# SPLUNK
SPLUNK
In this Lab i was able to download Splunk and complete some basic tasks to get a better understanding of everything. overall it is not a difficult program, and it can also save a lot of time for end-users.

In this photo, I went ahead and add data to spunk, uploaded from my personal PC that the course gave me.

I do have the option get data from other two methods that I went ahead and did on my end. Monitor and Forward.

Here Forwarding is the process where a Splunk instance, called a forwarder, sends data to another Splunk instance (typically an indexer or a heavy forwarder). Forwarders are responsible for collecting data from sources like log files, network streams, or APIs, and then transmitting that data to be indexed and searched.

Here i did a search and was able to find how many different client ips are requesting the "/productscreen.html" path. Finding that answer on "INTERESTING FILEDS and looking under "underip" or just the number exactly next to it.

I also went ahead and created different roles. A good practice is to create another administrator account and use admin only in emergency cases. Thus, if you see an admin connection you can see there is a problem.
